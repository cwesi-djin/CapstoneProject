This project is my Capstone Project for the ALX Backend program. It is a E-Commerce web application built with Django, Django REST Framework, (hope to add React later into the future). The goal of this project is to design and implement something close to a real-world online store that allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, and complete orders, while providing admin users with full product and order management capabilities.
